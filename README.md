 Car Dealership Database Project

A fully resettable SQL database with sample data + test scripts

 Overview

This project builds a complete Car Dealership Database using MySQL.
Your master SQL script:

 Drops the database (if it exists)
 Creates all tables
 Inserts sample data
 Can be safely run over and over

You also created a set of test scripts (one query per file) to verify that your database works correctly.
